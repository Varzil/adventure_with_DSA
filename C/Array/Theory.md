## Array in C

### Need for array
If we have a small number of elements, let us say we want 3 variables, then we can declare them separately like var1, var2, and var3. 

But if we have a large number of variables then we can use arrays to store them.

### Advantages of Array in C

Arrays have a great significance in the C language. They provide several advantages to the programmers while programming. Some of them are:
- Arrays make the code more optimized and clean since we can store multiple elements in a single array at once, so we do not have to write or initialize them multiple times.
- Every element can be traversed in an array using a single loop.

- Arrays make sorting much easier.

- Elements can be sorted by writing a few lines of code.

- Any array element can be accessed in any order either from the front or rear in O(1) time.


- Insertion or deletion of the elements can be done in linear complexity in an array.
